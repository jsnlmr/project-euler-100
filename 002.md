# Even Fibonacci Numbers

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence that do not exceed the nth term, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

### Ruby Solutions
```
def fiboEvenSum(n)
  fibo = 2
  total = 0
  count = 2
  lastNum = 1

  while count <= n do
    total += fibo % 2 == 0 ? fibo : 0
    temp = lastNum + fibo
    lastNum = fibo
    fibo = temp
    count += 1
  end
```

```
def fiboEvenSum(n)
  fibo = [1, 2]

  while fibo.size < n do
    nextNum = fibo[-1] + fibo[-2]
    fibo.push(nextNum)
    nextNum += fibo[-2]
  end

  fibo.select{|x| x % 2 == 0}.reduce{|a, b| a+b}
end
```

### JavaScript Solutions
```
function fiboEvenSum(n) {
  let fibo = 2
  let total = 0
  let count = 2
  let lastNum = 1

  while(count <= n) {
    total += fibo % 2 == 0 ? fibo : 0
    let temp = lastNum + fibo

    lastNum = fibo
    fibo = temp
    count++
  }

  return total
}

fiboEvenSum(10);
```

```
function fiboEvenSum(n) {
  let fibo = [1, 2]

  while(fibo.length < n) {
    let size = fibo.length
    let nextNum = fibo[size - 1] + fibo[size - 2]

    fibo.push(nextNum)
    nextNum += fibo[size -1 ]
  }

  return fibo.filter(x => x % 2 == 0).reduce((a,b) => a + b)
}
